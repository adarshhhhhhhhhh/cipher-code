# 🕵️‍♂️ Substitution Cipher - CS50 Problem Set

This is my solution to the **Substitution Cipher** problem from [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

The program encrypts plaintext using a substitution cipher based on a provided key.

## 🧠 How It Works

You run the program with a 26-letter key (like `YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO`) and then enter the plaintext. The output is a ciphertext with letters substituted accordingly.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Run in CS50 IDE (Recommended ✅)

1. Go to [https://cs50.io](https://cs50.io) and log in.
2. Open your IDE and create a new folder.
3. Upload `substitution.c` into that folder.
4. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   make substitution
